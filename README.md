# Evaluating-unsupervised-anomalydetection-algorithms
One-class classifiers have shown a good performance when implemented for classification tasks as faults detection, bot detection in social networks or DDOS attacks detection. In this study, a comparative statistical analysis was developed in order to evaluate the performance between four variations of an algorithm called Bagging-Random Miner, with Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski and Cosine distances and three different one-class classifiers: one-class Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Mixture Model, and Isolation Forest. Each of the algorithms was evaluated over 60 Anomaly Detection datasets without pre-processing, using Min-Max scaling and using Standard normalizing, by computing the Area Under the Curve metric. The results were used to generate box plots for visualization, to perform a Friedman statistical test with a pos-thoc test in order to create a CD diagram.
